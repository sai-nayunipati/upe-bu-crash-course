### Foreword

Computer science is one of BU's most popular majors. If you have a later [course registration time](https://www.bu.edu/reg/calendars/registration/) slot, it's not uncommon to open Student Link only to find the classes you wanted fully booked. This guide should help you build your ideal schedule and stick to it!

### Before Registration

The most important thing to do before registration is to **develop a plan**. Three to five hours of strategizing can help you avoid a semester of boring classes and potentially delayed graduation. Planning becomes especially important if you are pursuing a double major or aim to graduate early. I recommend the [BU Blueprint](https://www.bu.edu/hub/files/2019/08/BU-Blueprint.pdf), which is the advising department's four-year planning worksheet.

#### As you are choosing courses, consider the following:

- **Graduation Requirements:** These include the [Computer Science Major Requirements](https://www.bu.edu/cs/undergraduate/academic-programs/computer-science-major/) and [BU Hub Requirements](https://www.bu.edu/hub/advising-and-the-hub/hub-requirements-for-students/).
- **Prerequisites:** For example, you can only take CS 237 (Probability in Computing) after successfully completing CS 131 (Combinatoric Structures).
- **Industry Value:** Courses like CS 411 (Software Engineering) and CS 460 (Introduction to Database Systems) are popular because they directly translate to marketable skills on your resume.

At minimum, you should be confident that you're making enough progress to graduate on time. You should also have one or two backup courses for every popular class you want to take. As your registration date approaches, periodically check Student Link for course availability and adjust your plan approporiately.

#### Registration Times

Registration times are based on seniority. Seniors pick classes before juniors, who in turn pick before underclassmen. If you have more credits than your current class standing (from A.P. classes, overloading, etc.), consider submitting the [CAS Change of Class Form](https://www.bu.edu/cas/academics/undergraduate-education/academic-advising/advising/forms/cas-advising-change-of-class-year-form/) form to bump up your class standing. For example, in my second year I directly went from sophomore to senior standing, skipping junior pick times entirely.

> Note: Changing your class standing may affect scholarships and other logistics. Email your advisor if this is a concern.

#### Edge Cases:

- Some students might ask upperclassmen to hold seats for them. This practice is prohibited and, in my experience, not feasible because classes can be restricted based on prerequisites and major/college.
- Not all instructors enforce prerequisites. They may waive them if you send the professor a succinct email with compelling reasons on why you want to take the course and how you can be successful in it even without having taken the prerequisites.
- Student Link allows you to register for overlapping sections. This is occasionally useful. For example, if the class you want has a lab that conflicts with something else, you can register for it anyway and ask to attend another section instead. Be careful when registering for concurrent lectures. Instructors do not have to accomodate you if two of your classes schedule exams during the same class time and they don't have to give you access to lecture recordings.

### Registration

You must be on time for registration because section seats can fill up within moments. I would set an alarm. If possible, do a registration "dry runs" to explore the Student Link user interface. I've had lecture seats swiped from under me because I was confused by some registration menus, delaying me by seconds.

### After Registration

Virtually all C.S. students will experience a time when they cannot register for a course they really want or need. This can be stressful. However:

1. The registrar often opens more sections if a registration season is especially competitive.
2. You can use free apps to notify you when a class opens up.

Two popular apps for detecting open seats are [Coursicle](https://www.coursicle.com/) and [BU Ninja](https://buninja.com/). You can also use the "Terrier Alert" Telegram bot created by UPE member Aaron Ang ([subscription link](https://t.me/BUClassBot)). These tools periodically scrape Student Link and send you a push notification when it detects that someone has unenrolled. Over the course of an intersession break, you will most likely receive several of these notifications. You can use multiple of these tools simultaneously to increase the likelihood that you'll be notified before someone else.
Some C.S. students also create their own web scrapers. For example, you can use the [Terrier Alert](https://github.com/aaron-ang/terrier-alert) repository as a template for a similar Python project. By using tools like these, I have never had a schedule I was unsatisfied with.

> Tip: Joining UPE gives you access to our Slack channel. Our members frequently ping each other when they notice class openings, want insight into a course or professor, or have recommedations of their own.

### F.A.Q.s

#### What non-C.S. classes can replace major requirements?

Math classes can usually replace their C.S. equivalents. For instance, MA 242 (Linear Algebra) can substitute for CS 132 (Geometrical Algorithms) as a Group B requirement. (Note that the converse is not true. A math major cannot replace MA 242 with CS 132.) This is useful in several scenarios. For example, math and statistics joint majors are usually required to take the more general course instead of the C.S. one. They are also an option if the normal C.S. courses are overbooked. In my experience, the math versions of a C.S. class are no more difficult.
You can also look at Questrom classes such as QST BA 472 (Business Experiments and Causal Methods) and QST BA 476 (Machine Learning for Business Analytics) or Economics classes such as CAS EC 403 (Game Theory).
