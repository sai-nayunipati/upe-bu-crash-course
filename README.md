The UPE@BU Computer Science Major Guide aims to help first-year C.S. students understand the resources they have on campus. Content includes guides to on-campus opportunities, local hackathons, coursework, and BU-specific advice on getting technical internships to improve your career. Upsilon Pi Epsilon is a student group that's unaffiliated with Boston University's C.S. department. Please refer to the [C.S. Department Website](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) for official BU news.

If you are interested in content like this, please consider joining our chapter of Upsilon Pi Epsilon. Our applications open every fall and spring semester after _Splash!_.
